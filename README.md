# Fractol Project

Welcome to the Fractol project! This project explores fractals using interactive visualization techniques. Currently, it focuses on two famous fractals: the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.

## Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers \( c \) for which the function \( f(z) = z^2 + c \) does not diverge when iterated from \( z = 0 \). Here's an image of the Mandelbrot set:

### Features
- Zooming and panning to explore different regions of the Mandelbrot set.
- Color gradients to visualize the iteration counts.

## Julia Sets

Julia sets are related to the Mandelbrot set and are defined similarly. Each point \( c \) in the complex plane corresponds to a unique Julia set. Here's an image of a Julia set:

### Features
- Interactive parameter selection to generate different Julia sets.
- Real-time rendering and visualization of Julia sets.
